By including an explicit Bayesian model of uncertainty and by optimizing the policy via a reward-driven process, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a data-driven framework for dialog modelling. 2. Provides an overview of the current state of the art in the development of POMDP-based spoken dialog systems.|
|[A Neural Conversational Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05869)|Arxiv 2015|1. Present a simple approach for conversation modelling which uses the recently proposed sequence to sequence framework. 2. It can be trained end-to-end and thus requires much fewer hand-crafted rules|
|[A Persona-Based Neural Conversation Model](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1094)|ACL 2016|1. Present persona-based models for handling the issue of speaker consistency in neural response generation. 2. Yield qualitative performance improvements in both perplexity and BLEU scores over baseline sequence-to-sequence models, with similar gains in speaker consistency as measured by human judges.|
|[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dialogue Generation](https://aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1127)|EMNLP 2016|1.

Investigate evaluation metrics for dialogue response generation systems where supervised labels, such as task completion, are not available. 2. Show that current automatic metrics correlate very weakly with human judgement in the non-technical Twitter domain, and not at all in the technical Ubuntu domain|
|[Building End-To-End Dialogue Systems Using Generative Hierarchical Neural Network Models](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/11957/12160)|AAAI 2016|1. Extend the recently proposed hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder neural network to the dialogue domain, and demonstrate that this model is competitive with state-of-the-art neural language models and back-off n-gram models. 2. Investigate the limitations of this and similar approaches, and show how its performance can be improved by bootstrapping the learning from a larger question-answer pair corpus and from pretrained word embeddings|
|[Topic Aware Neural Response Generation](https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI17/paper/download/14563/14260)|AAAI 2016|1. Consider incorporating topic information into the sequence-to-sequence framework to generate informative and interesting responses for chatbots. 2. Utilizes topics to simulate prior knowledge of human that guides them to form informative and interesting responses in conversation, and leverages the topic information in generation by a joint attention mechanism and a biased generation probability.|
|[A Simple, Fast Diverse Decoding Algorithm for Neural Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08562)|Arxiv 2016|1.

|[Generative Deep Neural Networks for Dialogue: A Short Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.06216)|Arxiv 2016|Review recently proposed models based on generative encoder-decoder neural network architectures, and show that these models have better ability to incorporate long-term dialogue history, to model uncertainty and ambiguity in dialogue, and to generate responses with high-level compositional structure.|
|[On the Evaluation of Dialogue Systems with Next Utterance Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05414)|Arxiv 2016|1. Investigate the performance of humans on this task to validate the relevance of Next Utterance Classification (NUC) as a method of evaluation. 2. Results show three main findings: (1) humans are able to correctly classify responses at a rate much better than chance, thus confirming that the task is feasible, (2) human performance levels vary across task domains (we consider 3 datasets) and expertise levels (novice vs experts), thus showing that a range of performance is possible on this type of task, (3) automated dialogue systems built using state-of-the-art machine learning methods have similar performance to the human novices, but worse than the experts, thus confirming the utility of this class of tasks for driving further research in automated dialogue systems.|
|[Learning Discourse-level Diversity for Neural Dialog Models using Conditional Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10960)|ACL 2017| 1. Present a novel framework based on conditional variational autoencoders that captures the discourse-level diversity in the encoder. The proposed model uses latent variables to learn a distribution over potential conversational intents and generates diverse responses using only greedy decoders. 2. Further develop a novel variant that is integrated with linguistic prior knowledge for better performance. 3. Propose a bag-of-word loss to alleviate the problem of vanishing KL loss.|

|[Adversarial Learning for Neural Dialogue Generation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1230)|EMNLP 2017| 1. Propose using adversarial training for open-domain dialogue generation: the system is trained to produce sequences that are indistinguishable from human-generated dialogue utterances. 2. Cast the task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem where we jointly train two systems, a generative model to produce response sequences, and a discriminator---analagous to the human evaluator in the Turing test--- to distinguish between the human-generated dialogues and the machine-generated ones. 3. Some appealing research directions.|

Describe a new system for the automatic creation of poetry in Basque that not only generates novel poems, but also creates them conveying a certain attitude or state of mind. 2. The proposed system receives as an input the topic of the poem and the affective state (positive, neutral or negative) and tries to give as output a novel poem that: (1) satisfies formal constraints of rhyme and metric, (2) shows coherent content related to the given topic, and (3) expresses them through the predetermined mood.|
|[Emotional Human-Machine Conversation Generation Based on Long Short-Term Memory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-017-9539-4)|Cognitive Computation 2017| 1. Propose a new model based on long short-term memory, which is used to achieve an encoder-decoder framework, and we address the emotional factor of conversation generation by changing the model’s input using a series of input transformations: a sequence without an emotional category, a sequence with an emotional category for the input sentence, and a sequence with an emotional category for the output responses.|

|[Memory-augmented Dialogue Management for Task-oriented Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00150)|Arxiv 2018| 1. Propose a novel Memory-Augmented Dialogue management model (MAD) which employs a memory controller and two additional memory structures, i.e., a slot-value memory and an external memory. 2.The slot-value memory tracks the dialogue state by memorizing and updating the values of semantic slots (for instance, cuisine, price, and location), and the external memory augments the representation of hidden states of traditional recurrent neural networks through storing more context information. 3. Propose slot-level attention on user utterances to extract specific semantic information for each slot to update the dialogue state efficiently|

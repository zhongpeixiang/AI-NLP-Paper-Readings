# AC - Basic Theory

### Definition 
The design of systems that can recognize, interpret and simulate human emotions and related affective phenomena.

### Research objective
Principles and theories explaining why and how affective factors condition interaction between humans and technology, on how affective sensing and simulation techniques can inform our understanding of human affective processes, and on the design and implementation and evaluation of systems that carefully consider affect among the factors that influence their usability.

### Research topics

#### Affective state recognition:

1. Sensing and analysis: algorithms and features for the recognition of affective state from face and body gestures

2. Analysis of text and spoken language for emotion recognition

3. Analysis of prosody and voice quality of affective speech

4. Recognition of auditory and visual affect bursts

5. Recognition of affective state from central and peripheral physiological measures

6. Methods for multi-modal recognition of affective state

7. Recognition of group emotion

Definition: the design of systems that can recognize, interpret and simulate human emotions and related affective phenomena.

Affective model:

8. Methods of data collection with respect to psychological issues as mood induction and elicitation methodology as motion capturing

9. Tools and methods of annotation for provision of emotional corpora. Clarification of concepts related to 'affective computing'

10. Computational models of human emotion processes (decision-making models that account for the influence of emotion; predictive models of user emotional state, etc.)

Affective expression:

11. Studies on cross-cultural, group and cross-language differences in emotional expression

12. Contributions to standards and markup language for affective computing. Computational models of visual, acoustic and textual emotional expression for synthetic and robotic agents

13. Models of verbal and nonverbal expression of various forms of affect that facilitate machine implementation

Affective interaction:

14. Methods to adapt interaction with technology to the affective state of users

15. Computational methods for influencing the emotional state of people

16. New methods for defining and evaluating the usability of affective systems and the role of affect in usability

17. Methods of emotional profiling and adaptation in mid- to long-term interaction

Affective computing applications:

18. Application of affective computing including education, health care, entertainment, customer service, design, vehicle operation, social agents/robotics, affective ambient intelligence, customer experience measurement, multimedia retrieval, surveillance systems, biometrics, music retrieval and generation
